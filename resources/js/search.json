This guide focuses on building BlissRom for official devices with dedicated maintainers. Please note that this guide does not cover the process of porting devices.","Building a custom ROM requires patience and perseverance. If you encounter any issues during the build process, it is recommended to wait for your maintainer to address them. Alternatively, you can reach out to the maintainer with a polite message or even attempt to fix the issue yourself. By contributing to the project, you can make a valuable impact and even submit your fixes via merge requests.","Let's dive into the details and get started on building BlissRom for your device!"]}],[{"l":"Preparations"},{"l":"System requirements for building BlissRoms","p":["Before you begin building BlissRoms, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:","Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 or a newer version (LTS).","Storage: At least 200GB of available HDD/SSD space.","RAM: A minimum of 8GB RAM is required for smooth operation.","CPU: A decent CPU (or multiple CPUs for server motherboards) is recommended to expedite the build process.","While other Linux distributions may work, this guide specifically focuses on Ubuntu, which is officially supported for building BlissRoms.","Please note the following considerations","Underpowered machines may experience crashes during compilation due to resource limitations. If you encounter crashes, try restarting the build process as most issues are caused by insufficient memory.","If your storage space is running low, you may need to build on a different hard drive with sufficient space.","Ensure that your system meets these requirements to proceed with the BlissRoms build process."]}],[{"l":"Setting Up Environment"},{"l":"Package Installations","p":["Open your web browser and go to Akhilnarang Scripts.","Clone the entire repository by running the following command in your terminal:","Navigate to the cloned repository by running the following command:","Depending on your Linux distribution, execute the appropriate command below to set up the necessary dependencies for your build environment:","For Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions, run:","(This is the recommended option for beginners to avoid any potential issues.)","For Arch-based distributions (e.g., Manjaro), run:","For Fedora, run:","For OpenSUSE, run:","For Solus, run:","Wait patiently while all the dependencies are being installed.","Add it to PATH","Open .bashrc","Scroll to the end of the file and type these lines:","Ctrl-O and enter to save, then Ctrl-X to exit nano.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team.","Thank you for choosing BlissROMs, and happy ROM building!"]}],[{"l":"Troubleshoot"},{"l":"Troubleshooting","p":["If your build fails, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:","Perform a fresh repo sync: Sometimes, your local repository may not be up to date or there could be issues with the internet connection between you and GitHub. Running repo sync again can resolve these issues in most cases.","Check your dependencies: Error messages can provide valuable information about missing shared or linked libraries. Make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed correctly.","Ensure you sourced build/envsetup.sh: Sourcing the build/envsetup.sh script is essential for setting up the build environment. If commands like breakfast and lunch are not working, it's possible that you missed this step. Source build/envsetup.sh again, especially if you have performed a repo sync.","Verify your location in the build tree: Make sure you are in the root directory of the build tree. You can quickly navigate to the root directory by using the command croot.","Check if breakfast ran successfully: Running breakfast is crucial to ensure that device-specific files are properly configured. If there are any errors during this step, it may prevent successful builds.","Ensure your computer meets the minimum requirements: Compiling AOSP requires a certain amount of memory and CPU power. Verify that your computer meets the minimum system requirements to complete the build successfully.","Check for hardware issues: While rare, it's possible that your computer may have hardware issues that can affect the build process. To rule out this possibility, you can use stress-test programs like Prime95 to check the stability of your computer.","If you have exhausted all the above troubleshooting steps and are still facing issues, follow these additional steps:","Search for solutions online: Use search engines like Google to look up the specific error message you encountered. Many common errors have been encountered and resolved by the development community. You may find helpful insights or solutions to your problem.","Seek assistance from the BlissROMs community: If you are unable to resolve the issue on your own, you can seek help from the BlissROMs Telegram Build Support chat. However, please note that the support provided is specific to BlissROMs and not other custom ROMs.","By following these troubleshooting steps and reaching out for assistance when needed, you can overcome challenges and successfully build your custom ROM using BlissROMs."]}],[{"l":"General overlays"},{"l":"General Overlays"},{"i":"-refresh-rate-overlays","l":"• Refresh Rate Overlays","p":["This overlay is required to Enable Refresh Rate Controls."]},{"i":"-charging-support-overlay","l":"• Charging Support Overlay","p":["- VOOC Charging ( If your device supports )","This overlay is required to Enable VOOC charging support.","- WARP Charging ( If your device supports )","This overlay is required to Enable Warp charging support.","- Dash Charging ( If your device supports )","This overlay is required to Enable Dash charging support."]},{"i":"-multi-usb-controller-overlay-only-for-asus-rog-devices","l":"• Multi usb controller overlay (ONLY FOR ASUS ROG DEVICES)","p":["Since all ROG devices have 2 usb ports.
