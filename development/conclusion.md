### Conclusion

Building a ROM is very hard and tedious and the results are very rewarding! If you managed to follow along, congratulations!

After you finish building, you can try out the Git Started guide. Make changes, commit, and send them off to our [Gerrit](https://review.blissroms.org) for review! Or better yet, download experimental commits not ready for the mainline repositories and review them! Again, ROM building is a fun project you can work with. I hope this guide was a lot of fun to run through!
