### Troubleshooting

If your build fails, there are several steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Perform a fresh `repo sync`:** Sometimes, your local repository may not be up to date or there could be issues with the internet connection between you and GitHub. Running `repo sync` again can resolve these issues in most cases.

2. **Check your dependencies:** Error messages can provide valuable information about missing shared or linked libraries. Make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed correctly. 

3. **Ensure you sourced `build/envsetup.sh`:** Sourcing the `build/envsetup.sh` script is essential for setting up the build environment. If commands like `breakfast` and `lunch` are not working, it's possible that you missed this step. Source `build/envsetup.sh` again, especially if you have performed a `repo sync`.

4. **Verify your location in the build tree:** Make sure you are in the root directory of the build tree. You can quickly navigate to the root directory by using the command `croot`.

5. **Check if `breakfast` ran successfully:** Running `breakfast` is crucial to ensure that device-specific files are properly configured. If there are any errors during this step, it may prevent successful builds.

6. **Ensure your computer meets the minimum requirements:** Compiling AOSP requires a certain amount of memory and CPU power. Verify that your computer meets the minimum system requirements to complete the build successfully.

7. **Check for hardware issues:** While rare, it's possible that your computer may have hardware issues that can affect the build process. To rule out this possibility, you can use stress-test programs like Prime95 to check the stability of your computer.

If you have exhausted all the above troubleshooting steps and are still facing issues, follow these additional steps:

1. **Search for solutions online:** Use search engines like Google to look up the specific error message you encountered. Many common errors have been encountered and resolved by the development community. You may find helpful insights or solutions to your problem.
