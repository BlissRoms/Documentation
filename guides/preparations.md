# Build BlissRoms

## System requirements for building BlissRoms

Before you begin building BlissRoms, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 18.04 or a newer version (LTS).
- **Storage:** At least 200GB of available HDD/SSD space.
- **RAM:** A minimum of 8GB RAM is required for smooth operation.
- **CPU:** A decent CPU (or multiple CPUs for server motherboards) is recommended to expedite the build process.

While other Linux distributions may work, this guide specifically focuses on Ubuntu, which is officially supported for building BlissRoms.

Please note the following considerations:

- Underpowered machines may experience crashes during compilation due to resource limitations. If you encounter crashes, try restarting the build process as most issues are caused by insufficient memory.
- If your storage space is running low, you may need to build on a different hard drive with sufficient space.

Ensure that your system meets these requirements to proceed with the BlissRoms build process.
