# Introduction

## Overview of the guide and its purpose

Welcome to the official guide for building BlissRom on your device. This guide focuses on building BlissRom for official devices with dedicated maintainers. Please note that this guide does not cover the process of porting devices.

Building a custom ROM requires patience and perseverance. If you encounter any issues during the build process, it is recommended to wait for your maintainer to address them. Alternatively, you can reach out to the maintainer with a polite message or even attempt to fix the issue yourself. By contributing to the project, you can make a valuable impact and even submit your fixes via merge requests.

Let's dive into the details and get started on building BlissRom for your device!
